# Question-guided Knowledge Graph Re-scoring and Injection for Knowledge Graph Question Answering
Figure 3, from the paper, is presented in the Qualitative Analysis section (6.1). 

Figure3_nodes is an extended version of Figure 3, containing more nodes. This expanded graph demonstrates that the edge scoring method predicts higher scores for question-relevant edges, rather than the high-relevance edges connecting to more question-and-answer nodes.

Question:
There is an ancient invention still used in some parts of the world today that allows people to see through walls. Fans is it.
Options:
(A) Fans     (B) window    (C) electric socket
